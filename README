Ok, here is a quickie introduction -if u know what I mean-, so this is how it goes for now,
you can set a device and add partitions to it using the following code:

############################

from reparted.device import *

dev = Device("/dev/sdb") # or whatever your preferred dev is.
disk = dev.disk()
sz = Size(200, "MB")
new = Partition(disk, sz) # this defaults the filesystem to ext3 and partition type "NORMAL"
#new = Partition(disk, sz, fs="ext4") # set the filesystem blocks to ext4
#new = Partition(disk, sz, fs="ext4", name="hire_ruben") # set a name
disk.add_partition(new)
disk.commit()

############################

Now you can access partition properties and methods from the partition instance "new":

disk            -Returns an instance of Disk
geom            -Returns a 3-tuple (start_sector, end_sector, length_in_sectors)
num             -Returns the partition number
type            -Returns the partition type (EXTENDED, NORMAL, LOGICAL, etc...)
fs_type         -Returns the filesystem block geometry type (ext3, ext4, etc...)
name            -The partition name if set
set_name        -If the partition table supports names you can change it with this method,
                    you will need to commit the changes to disk though

############################

Disk Stuff

You can create an instance of a disk by providing a device or accessing the disk method from
the Device class:

    dev = Device("/dev/sdb") # or whatever your preferred dev is.
    disk = dev.disk()

    OR

    dev = Device("/dev/sdb") # or whatever your preferred dev is.
    disk = Disk(dev)

These are the properties and methods for disk instances:

type_name       -Returns the disk partition table name (gpt, dvh, etc...)
type_features   -Returns either PARTITION_NAME (supports naming partitions)
                    or EXTENDED (lvm stuff, no naming partitions for you!)
block_sizes     -the disk block sizes.
needs_clobber   -True or False.
update_mode     -True or False
partitions      -Returns a list of partitions in disk (as Partition instances).
                    METADATA, FREESPACE and PROTECTED partitions are not included.
add_partition   -Takes a Partition instance and adds it to the disk partition table.
                    NOTE: You must call commit to save your changes to disk.
delete_partition       -Takes either a Partition instance or partition number and deletes it.
delete_all      -Deletes all partitions
commit          -Commits changes to disk.
