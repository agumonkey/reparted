Introduction
============

Reparted is my attempt at learning python ctypes module to create bindings for c api's so use it
at your own risk. I was a bit confused on the way parted and pyparted interface works, my aim was
to create a simple interface. It does not have the full set of features parted has to offer, only
enough to create and delete partitions and set the labels. It has been tested using python 2.7 and
libparted 3.0. Feel free to check the code and point out enhancements. For any questions my email is rq.sysadmin@gmail.com, have fun!
